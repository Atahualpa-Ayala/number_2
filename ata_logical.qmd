## A few logical expressions

Hi

```{r}
5 == 1

"cat" == "dog"

meds<- c(1,2,3,4,5)
meds == 3
meds == 1 | meds > 3

teddy <- 5
banjo <- 7
tallie <- 4

teddy

teddy <= banjo


```

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
